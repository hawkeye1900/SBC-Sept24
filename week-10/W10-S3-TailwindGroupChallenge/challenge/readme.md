# Build a Multi-Page React Application with State Management

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, you will design, build, test, and deploy a multi-page React application. The project will simulate an e-commerce website, featuring responsive design, state management with React Context, and navigation using React Router DOM. You are encouraged to utilize a third-party UI framework such as Daisy UI or Material UI to enhance the design and user experience.

Finally, you will deploy your application to a hosting platform like Render.com, Netlify, or Heroku, ensuring your application is publicly accessible.

## User Story

As a user, I want an intuitive and visually appealing e-commerce website where I can:

1. Browse a catalog of products with pagination or filtering options.
2. View detailed information about individual products.
3. Add items to a shopping cart.
4. View my shopping cart and manage its contents (e.g., add, remove items).

## Acceptance Criteria

Your application should meet the following requirements:

### **Core Functionalities**

1. **Navigation:**

   - Implement React Router DOM with at least three main pages: Home, Product Details, and Shopping Cart.
   - Provide a working navigation menu for seamless transitions between pages.

2. **State Management:**

   - Use React Context to manage the state for:
     - Products data.
     - Shopping cart contents.

3. **Responsive Design:**

   - Use a third-party UI framework (e.g., Material UI or Daisy UI) to build a responsive layout.
   - Ensure the application looks and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

4. **Dynamic Product Pages:**

   - Display individual product details using a dynamic route (e.g., `/product/:id`).

5. **Shopping Cart:**
   - Users should be able to add products to their cart from the product details or catalog page.
   - Users should be able to view and manage the cart contents.

### **Deployment**

- Deploy the application to a hosting platform like Render.com, Netlify, or Heroku.
- Provide a working link to the deployed application.
