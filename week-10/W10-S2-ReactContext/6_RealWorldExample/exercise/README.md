# React Context in Action

## Challenge

You’ve been provided with a simple online store application that uses React Context to manage shopping basket data, including methods to add and update items in the basket. Your task is to review the application code, analyze how React Context is applied to manage global state, and respond to the `TODO` comments throughout the code by adding informative comments. This exercise will help solidify your understanding of how React Context works in a real-world application by diving into its implementation in a multi-component environment.

## Key Learnings

- Understanding and applying React Context in a real-world scenario
- Analyzing how React Context can centralize and manage global state across multiple components
- Developing skills to read and interpret code that utilizes React Context

## User Story

**As a developer**, I want to understand how React Context is used to manage global state in a real-world application **so that** I can confidently implement similar functionality in other projects.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Code Review**: Review the provided codebase to understand how basket data and update methods are managed through React Context.
- **Add Comments**: Respond to each `TODO` comment throughout the code by adding detailed comments that explain the code’s functionality and purpose.
  - **Explain Context Setup**: Describe the purpose and structure of the Context Provider.
  - **Clarify Methods**: Explain how each method (e.g., adding and updating items) works and why it is implemented in the Context.
  - **Describe Consumption**: Comment on components that consume the basket context, explaining how they access and use the context data.
- **Error-Free**: Ensure that all comments are syntactically correct and do not cause any issues with the application’s execution.

### Additional Criteria (Stretch Goals)

- **Detailed Explanations**: Write a short summary (3-5 sentences) at the top of the Context Provider file, summarizing its purpose and functionality.
- **Explore Performance Optimization**: Research `React.memo` or `useMemo` and add a comment suggesting where these optimizations might improve the application if needed.
- **Write a README Section**: Add a new section in the application’s README file explaining how React Context is used in this app, including any relevant insights from your code review.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Application**: Open the provided online store application, inspect its file structure, and familiarize yourself with its use of React Context for managing the shopping basket.
2. **Analyze the Context Provider**: Locate the Context Provider file responsible for handling basket data and methods to add and update items. Pay attention to its state, methods, and the values it provides to the rest of the app.
3. **Respond to TODO Comments**: Find each `TODO` comment throughout the codebase and add a detailed response, explaining the code’s purpose and how it fits into the larger application.
4. **Test the Application**: Run the application to verify that it works as expected and that the new comments enhance readability and understanding.
5. **Stretch Goals (Optional)**:
   - Summarize the Context Provider at the top of the file.
   - Suggest performance optimizations using `React.memo` or `useMemo` where applicable.
   - Write a README section explaining the app’s usage of React Context and any unique implementation details.

Happy coding!
