# **Final Project: Full-Stack Application Development**

## **Session 3: Core Feature Development and Integration**

### **Project Overview**

In this session, your team will begin implementing the core features of your full-stack application. This includes developing user interaction features, setting up the authentication system, integrating the frontend and backend, and ensuring basic responsiveness. This is a critical step toward building a functional application.

---

### **Session Objectives**

1. **Develop Core Features**:
   - Implement features for user input and data display (e.g., forms, dashboards).
   - Ensure that these features are functional and testable.
2. **Set Up Authentication**:
   - Build a user authentication system (registration, login, logout).
   - Implement secure mechanisms like tokens or sessions.
3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
   - Establish communication between React (frontend) and Django (backend).
   - Test API endpoints to ensure seamless data exchange.
4. **Ensure Responsiveness**:
   - Begin applying responsive design principles for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

---

### **Expected Deliverables**

1. **Core Feature Implementation**:
   - At least one functional feature demonstrating user input and data handling.
2. **Authentication System**:
   - Registration, login, and logout functionalities in place and operational.
3. **API Integration**:
   - A working API endpoint integrated into the frontend with successful data flow.
4. **Responsive Layouts**:
   - Basic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

---

### **Session Activities**

#### **1. Frontend Development**

- Create interactive React components for user input and data display.
- Implement state management using React Context or Redux.
- Design and test responsive layouts.

#### **2. Backend Development**

- Build API endpoints to handle core application functionalities.
- Connect APIs to the database for dynamic data management.
- Test endpoints using tools like Postman.

#### **3. Authentication Setup**

- Implement user authentication in Django (e.g., using Django Rest Framework tokens or sessions).
- Create React components for:
  - **User Registration**: Collect and validate user details.
  - **User Login**: Authenticate users and handle sessions or tokens.
  - **Logout**: Securely clear user sessions.

#### **4. Frontend-Backend Integration**

- Connect React components to Django APIs.
- Test and refine data exchange processes for smooth integration.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

The application must:

1. **Display and Receive Input**: Include a functional feature for user interaction (e.g., a form, search bar).
2. **Use Authentication**: Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality.
3. **Be Responsive**: Ensure layouts adapt to all screen sizes.
4. **Integrate API Communication**: Achieve seamless data flow between React and Django.

---

### **Tips for Success**

- **Start Simple**: Focus on one feature or component at a time.
- **Test Frequently**: Test each feature and its integration to catch issues early.
- **Collaborate Effectively**: Share updates and work closely with teammates.
- **Document Progress**: Maintain a record of implemented features and their testing results.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. Continue developing core features in future sessions.
2. Refine and expand the authentication system.
3. Handle edge cases and error messages for a smoother user experience.
4. Assign testing tasks to ensure the application meets quality standards.
