# **Final Project: Full-Stack Application Development**

## **Session 2: Research and Planning**

### **Project Overview**

This session focuses on laying a solid foundation for your project by conducting research, creating wireframes, selecting technologies, and setting up the initial project structure. This work will prepare your team for the development phase in upcoming sessions.

---

### **Session Objectives**

1. **Conduct Research**:
   - Investigate similar applications and gather inspiration.
   - Explore new technologies or libraries that align with the project requirements.
2. **Create Wireframes**:
   - Design the application's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
   - Develop detailed mockups for all major screens and workflows.
3. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Initialize project repositories for both frontend (React) and backend (Django).
   - Create a clear and organized folder structure for the codebase.
4. **Prototype Key Features**:
   - Begin developing essential components like authentication, data input forms, or APIs.

---

### **Expected Deliverables**

1. **Research Summary**:
   - A document outlining the chosen tools, libraries, and best practices.
   - Justification for the new technology or library selected.
2. **Wireframes/Mockups**:
   - Visual designs for the core features and workflows of the application.
   - Tools like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), or [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) can be used.
3. **Project Repository Setup**:
   - Functional GitHub repositories for both the frontend and backend.
   - React and Django boilerplates with clear folder structures.
4. **Prototypes**:
   - Basic implementations of key features to test feasibility (e.g., login, registration, data forms).

---

### **Session Activities**

#### **1. Research**

- Analyze similar applications to identify inspiration and best practices.
- Explore new technologies or libraries for integration into your project.
  - Examples: UI frameworks, advanced form handling libraries, or data visualization tools.

#### **2. Wireframing**

- Sketch wireframes for the application's pages and components.
- Focus on user-friendly and responsive designs.

#### **3. Repository Setup**

- Initialize GitHub repositories for the frontend and backend.
- Set up basic folder structures:
  - **Frontend**: Component structure, assets, and routing.
  - **Backend**: App structure, database configuration, and API endpoints.

#### **4. Prototype Development**

- Develop basic prototypes for critical features:
  - Example: Authentication flow (e.g., login, registration).
  - Input forms or API calls for essential functionality.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

The application must:

1. **Display and Receive Input**: Include a feature for user interaction (e.g., a form, search bar).
2. **Use Authentication**: Implement user login, registration, and logout functionality.
3. **Be Responsive**: Ensure the application adapts to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
4. **Have an Intuitive UI**: Focus on clean, bug-free, and user-friendly designs.
5. **Integrate New Technology**: Include at least one tool or library not covered during the course.

---

### **Tips for Success**

- **Collaborate Efficiently**: Regularly communicate and share updates with your team.
- **Focus on Core Features**: Prioritize the most critical components first.
- **Document Everything**: Keep notes on research, design decisions, and setup processes for reference.
- **Test Early**: Validate prototypes and designs to avoid issues later.

---

### **Next Steps**

Prepare for **Session 3**:

1. Begin developing core application features based on the wireframes.
2. Assign coding tasks for both frontend and backend.
3. Test prototypes and refine designs as needed.
