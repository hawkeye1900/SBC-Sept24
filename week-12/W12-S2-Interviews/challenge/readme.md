# More Sort Algorithms

## Challenge

Now that you've learned about the Bubble Sort algorithm, it's time to explore more efficient alternatives! Your challenge is to:

1. Identify **two other sorting algorithms** (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.).
2. Research how each algorithm conceptually works.
3. Write a detailed explanation for each algorithm, including:
   - Step-by-step process.
   - Time and space complexity.
4. Compare all three algorithms (Bubble Sort and the two you researched) by analyzing their pros and cons.
