# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## Challenge

In this challenge, you will explore the **Bubble Sort Algorithm** by reviewing, researching, testing, and describing its functionality and limitations. You'll work with a simple JavaScript Bubble Sort function that takes an array as input and sorts it in ascending order.

### Tasks:

1. Analyze the provided JavaScript Bubble Sort function.
2. Test the function with various inputs to observe its behavior.
3. Answer the following questions:
   - How does the sort algorithm work?
   - What are the limitations of Bubble Sort?

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

1. Understand how the **Bubble Sort Algorithm** works.
2. Recognize its limitations, such as efficiency with larger datasets.
3. Practice implementing and testing a basic sorting algorithm in JavaScript.

## User Story

### As a student,

- I want to learn how the Bubble Sort algorithm operates,
- So that I can understand its applications and limitations in sorting tasks.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Code Understanding**:

   - I can read and explain the logic behind the provided Bubble Sort function.
   - I can identify how the function compares and swaps elements in the array.

2. **Testing**:

   - I can test the function with various arrays, including:
     - An array with already sorted elements.
     - An array sorted in reverse order.
     - An array with duplicate values.
     - An empty array or an array with one element.
   - I can document the results of my tests.

3. **Analysis**:

   - I can describe how Bubble Sort works step by step.
   - I can explain the algorithm's time complexity (O(nÂ²)) and its inefficiency for large datasets.
   - I can identify real-world scenarios where Bubble Sort might or might not be a suitable choice.

4. **Output and Presentation**:

## Starter Code

Here is the provided JavaScript Bubble Sort function:

```javascript
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  let swapped;
  do {
    swapped = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
        // Swap the elements
        [arr[i], arr[i + 1]] = [arr[i + 1], arr[i]];
        swapped = true;
      }
    }
  } while (swapped);
  return arr;
}
```

- Good luck!
