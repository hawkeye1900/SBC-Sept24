# Final Project: Full Stack Application Development

## Challenge

As a project group, your challenge is to develop an **interactive full-stack application** using **React** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend. This project represents the culmination of your learning and will be presented on the final day. Each team member must contribute to the project development and presentation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The application must:

1. **Display and Receive Input**: Include at least one feature that allows users to input data (e.g., a form, search bar).
2. **Use Authentication**: Implement a user authentication system (e.g., login/logout, registration).
3. **Be Responsive**: Ensure the application functions well on devices of all sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
4. **Have an Error-Free and Intuitive UI**: The user interface should be easy to use, visually appealing, and free from major bugs.
5. **Use New Technology**: Integrate at least one new technology or library that was not covered in class.

## Presentation Requirements

On the final day, your group will present the project. Each student should contribute to the presentation. Ensure your presentation includes the following:

1. **Introduction and Business Case**: Explain the purpose of your project and its value.
2. **Target Market/User Base**: Describe the intended audience for the application.
3. **Team Roles and Responsibilities**: Detail how tasks were divided and what each member contributed.
4. **Research**: Discuss what research was carried out and how it informed the project.
5. **Early Concepts and Development Journey**: Show evidence of planning, such as wireframes or prototypes, and how the application evolved.
6. **Technical Achievements and Challenges**: Highlight significant technical milestones and obstacles overcome during development.
7. **Software Demonstration**: Provide a live demo of the application, showcasing its key features.
8. **Future Developments**: Share ideas for potential improvements or next steps for the project.
9. **Q&A**: Be prepared to answer questions from the audience.

## Milestones

1. **Session 1**: Team formation and brainstorming. Decide on the project concept and assign roles.
2. **Session 2**: Research and planning. Complete wireframes, decide on technologies, build prototypes and set up the initial project structure.
3. **Session 3-4**: Development. Build core features, implement authentication, and test responsiveness.
4. **Session 5**: Testing and refinement. Ensure the application is error-free and user-friendly.
5. **Final Presentation**: Prepare the presentation and rehearse.

---

## Submission Requirements

1. **Final Application**: Submit a link to your hosted application (or instructions to run it locally) and the GitHub repository.
2. **Presentation Slides**: Include all required sections and ensure every team member has a clear role.
3. **Code Documentation**: Provide clear, concise comments and README files for your project.

## Tips for Success

- **Plan Early**: Spend time discussing ideas and planning the project structure before jumping into code.
- **Communicate Effectively**: Keep the team updated regularly through meetings or chats.
- **Test Frequently**: Regularly test the application during development to catch and fix bugs early.
- **Practice Your Presentation**: Rehearse to ensure you stay within time and deliver your message confidently.

Good luck, and have fun building your final project!
