# Bug Fixes and Product Enhancements

## Challenge

Welcome to a practical exercise simulating the day-to-day tasks of professional developers working on an ongoing project!

Today, you will contribute to the development of a secure technical article platform for Step8Up. The platform is built using **React** on the frontend and **Django** on the backend. You will be invited to the GitHub repository as a collaborator, where you will tackle a variety of GitHub Issues, including bug reports, feature requests, and development tasks.

Your objective is to use **branching** and **Pull Requests** (PRs) to address these issues. Youâ€™ll work collaboratively to pick tickets from the Issues, implement fixes or features, and integrate them into the main codebase to advance the platform's development.

## Getting Started

Follow the [README.md](https://github.com/SBC-Sep24/step8up-knowledge-base#readme) in the repository to set up the project locally.

## Key Learnings

- Collaborative development using **GitHub**.
- Addressing real-world challenges with **React** and **Django** development.
- Effective branching strategies and managing **Pull Requests**.
- Understanding and resolving **bug reports** and implementing **feature requests**.
- Working within an existing project structure.

## User Story

> As a developer, I want to contribute to a collaborative project by resolving reported issues and adding features, so that the platform evolves and becomes more robust.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Repository Access**

   - You are added as a collaborator to the GitHub repository for the Step8Up technical article platform.
   - You can clone the repository locally and set up the development environment.

2. **Issue Assignment**

   - You can navigate the GitHub Issues tab and select a bug report, feature request, or development task to work on.
   - Clearly assign yourself to the chosen ticket to avoid overlaps.

3. **Branching Strategy**

   - Create a new branch named after the issue you are working on (e.g., `fix-bug-123`, `feature-add-comments`).
   - Ensure your changes are committed to the branch.

4. **Bug Fixes and Feature Development**

   - For bug reports: Investigate the issue, implement a fix, and verify it resolves the problem.
   - For feature requests: Implement the feature based on the provided specifications and ensure it integrates well with the existing application.

5. **Testing**

   - Write or update tests as necessary to validate your changes.
   - Test your changes locally to ensure they do not introduce new issues.

6. **Pull Requests**

   - Open a Pull Request for your branch, providing a detailed description of your changes.
   - Ensure your PR is reviewed and approved by at least one other collaborator before merging.

7. **Collaboration and Communication**

   - Actively communicate with other collaborators about progress and challenges via GitHub comments or other agreed-upon channels.
   - Incorporate feedback from PR reviews into your branch before merging.

8. **Final Merge**
   - Successfully merge your PR into the main branch once all feedback is addressed and tests pass.

## Additional Notes

- Follow any coding style or guidelines outlined in the repository documentation.
- For React: Pay attention to component structure and state management best practices.
- For Django: Ensure the backend logic integrates seamlessly with the frontend, and follow proper security practices.
- If you encounter issues during development, feel free to reach out to your instructor or peers for support.
