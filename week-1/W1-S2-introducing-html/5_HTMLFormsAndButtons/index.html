		<p>I am an aspiring developer, learning Python and Javascript, plus Django and React. I spent nearly 30 years in the
			Police but having left that on retirement, I knew I wanted a job in IT. I have tried other avenues, such as networks
			and pen testing, but whilst I enjoyed those fields as well, in particular networks, I needed a role that was to provide me with the satisfaction, and crucially the lifestyle I'm after.
		</p>
		<p>As well as coding skills, I am proficient in git/GitHub, have basic linux skills for file management and am equally at home in small or large teams or working on my own. I've had full time office roles and been based at home as a Cyber Security Consultant, a position I took up with Airbus Defence and Space, after leaving the Police. As a Police Officer you learned to adapt, to changing priorities, circumstances, threats, and more. You learned to deal with unimaginable workloads, laughable deadlines and sometimes quite virulent customer demands. All these qualities make me an ideal fit for a developer role.
