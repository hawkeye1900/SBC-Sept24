	<p>I am an aspiring developer, learning Python and Javascript, plus Django and React. I spent nealry 30 years in the Police but having left that on retirement, I knew I wanted a job in IT. I have tried other avenues, such as networks and pen testing, but whilst I enjoyed those fields as well, I needed a role that was to provide me with the satisfaction, but crucually the lifestyle I'm after.</p>
