# üèÜ Python Challenge: Comprehensive System Integration

## üéØ Challenge

Your task is to develop a versatile Python application that integrates three key systems: a Personal Finance Manager, a Customer Feedback System, and an Inventory Management System. This unified tool will help users manage their personal finances, gather and analyze customer feedback, and track inventory items.

## üìö Key Learnings

Through this challenge, you'll apply various Python concepts, including variables, data structures, error handling, and user interaction. You'll create a cohesive application that uses these concepts to provide practical functionality and insights.

## üë§ User Story

Imagine you're building a comprehensive tool for managing personal finances, collecting and analyzing customer feedback, and overseeing inventory. Your application should efficiently handle financial tracking, feedback collection, and inventory management, providing users with actionable reports and alerts.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

Start by creating three Python files: `finance_manager.py`, `feedback_system.py`, and `inventory_system.py`, each responsible for one of the three systems. You'll also need a `data.json` file to store and retrieve data for all modules. In `finance_manager.py`, implement features to track expenses, compare them with a budget, and generate financial reports using lists and dictionaries. Ensure data is saved and loaded from `data.json` and allow user interaction for input and reporting.

In `feedback_system.py`, create functions to collect customer feedback, categorize it, calculate average ratings, and produce summary reports. Again, use dictionaries to manage feedback and JSON for data storage. Make sure users can submit feedback and view the results.

For `inventory_system.py`, manage inventory items by defining stock thresholds and handling stock levels with dictionaries. Implement functions to add items, update stock, and generate alerts for low stock. Use JSON to store inventory data and provide user interaction for managing stock.

Integrate all three systems so that data is shared and managed seamlessly across the modules. Ensure that the data in `data.json` is correctly handled and that users can switch between different functionalities within the application.

## Tips

Be sure to validate user input and handle exceptions effectively to create a robust application. Modularize your code to keep each system's functionality distinct yet interconnected. Properly comment your code to explain its purpose and functionality.

## Submission

Submit the following files for evaluation: `finance_manager.py`, `feedback_system.py`, `inventory_system.py`, and `data.json`. Ensure that your code is well-commented and demonstrates the successful integration of all three systems.
