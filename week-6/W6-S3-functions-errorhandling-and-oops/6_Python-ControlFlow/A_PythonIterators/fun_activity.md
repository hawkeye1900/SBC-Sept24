# 🚀 Iterators

## 🎯 Activity: Iterator Race

**Objective:** Create a race game where different iterators compete.

### Instructions:
1. Define several iterators with different behaviors (e.g., generating numbers, strings).
2. Create a script to simulate a race and see which iterator completes a task first.
3. Make it interactive by allowing users to create their own iterators and join the race.
