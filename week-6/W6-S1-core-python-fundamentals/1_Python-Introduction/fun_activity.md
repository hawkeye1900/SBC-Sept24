## 🎯 Activity: Build Your Own Magic Calculator

**Objective:** Create a calculator that uses variables to store and compute magical numbers. You can choose some "magic" numbers and create fun calculations and conversions.

### Instructions:
1. Define a variable `magic_number` with a value like 7.
2. Create functions to perform calculations with this number (e.g., doubling it, finding its square root).
3. Add some fun by using variables for user input, like asking them for their favorite number and comparing it to your `magic_number`.
